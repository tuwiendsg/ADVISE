For any research work in which ADVISE is used, please cite the paper: Georgiana Copil, Demetris Trihinas, Hong-Linh Truong, Daniel Moldovan, George Pallis, Schahram Dustdar, Marios Dikaiakos. "ADVISE - a Framework for Evaluating Cloud Service Elasticity Behavior" (submitted <a href="papers/icsoc_2014.pdf">PDF</a>) the 11th International Conference on Service Oriented Computing.

ADVISE framework is written in python, and available in <a href="https://github.com/tuwiendsg/ADVISE/tree/master/ADVISE-Core"> ADVISE-Core </a>. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/tuwiendsg/ADVISE/blob/master/ADVISE/User%20Guide.txt">user guide</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/tuwiendsg/ADVISE/wiki/ADVISE">wiki</a> detailing the necessary steps for using ADVISE.

For running ADVISE to find expected behavior of cloud services, you need to have MELA deployed and running, together with rSYBL or using ./control-stress-application, or choose already gathered data for the Video Service and M2M DaaS.
