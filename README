For running this, you need to have MELA deployed and running.

Configure files from ./config -> serviceDescription.xml for describing the different parts of the application and the newDeploymentDescription.xml for the current deployment (IPs, UUIDs needed of current servers, and UUID of existent servers).

Also clarify composition rules, depending on the names specified in serviceDescription.xml, and on the monitored metrics.
